# Octopus Energy Monitoring with Grafana 

I had a simple project in mind: creating a system to track energy usage and costs, and displaying them on a dashboard. To make it happen, I used a few tools:

* Grafana: It helped me design a user-friendly and interactive dashboard.
* MySQL: This reliable database allowed me to store all the energy data.
* Python: With this I used it to connect to my energy supplier API and pull the energy consumption for my account.

By combining these tools, I successfully built a simple script for monitoring and analysing energy consumption.

Here is an overview of the dashboard that shows the consumption
